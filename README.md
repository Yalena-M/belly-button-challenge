This project visualizes data from a JSON file using D3.js and Plotly. It features a  dashboard with two key charts: a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 bacterial cultures and a bubble chart representing the distribution of bacterial cultures with various sizes and colors. Users can select different samples from a dropdown menu, which updates both charts and the sample metadata panel to reflect the new selection.
